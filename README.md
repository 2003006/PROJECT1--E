# Domain –911
## Calls focus –data analysis and visualization
## Overview.
## Business challenge/requirement
For this capstone project we will be analyzing 911 call data from KaggleThis data is from Montgomery County in  Pennsylvania State of USA. 911 is most important social security feature of USA. It is the no. which citizens can call in case of any emergencies such as crime, medical, traffic, fire etc.As a data analyst you have to analyze and visualize the data  and answer the question in section Approach to Solve
## Key issues
Data should be analyzed accurately
## Considerations
- NONE
## Data volume & Description
Approx 260K  records –file 911.csv
Fields in Data are:
- lat : String variable, Latitude
- lng: String variable, Longitude
- desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
- zip: String variable, Zipcode
- title: String variable, Title
- timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- twp: String variable, Township
- addr: String variable, Address
- e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)

## Additional information
- NA
## Business benefits
- Better utilization of resources based on the density of 911 calls.
## Approach to Solve
- You have touse fundamentals covered till Module 8 and answer following 8 questions
## Data Analysis
- Compute  --What are the top 10 Zipcodes for 911  & Question 1: Are Zipcodes 19446 and 19090 present ?
- Compute --What are the top 4 townships (twp) for 911 calls  & Question 2: Which  of the following township are  not present? --LOWER POTTSGROVE, NORRISTOWN, HORSHAM, ABINGTON
- Compute --Create new features  & Question 3: What is the most common Reason for a 911 call based on Reason Column? Which comes second
- Compute --Plot barchart using matplot  for 911 calls by Reason  & Question 4: How can you plot the bars horizontally ?•Do data manipulation & Question 5: Which day got maximum calls for EMS and how many?
- Compute --Create a countplot of the Day of Week column with the hue based of the Reason column & Question 6: On which day traffic calls were lowest ?
- Compute --Create a countplot month wise  --Question 7: Which month saw highest calls for fire?
- Compute --Create Web Map for Traffic Calls  & Question 8: Why some areas seem tohave lower or almost zero traffic calls? Hint: Zoom the mapFor solution refer to files in project.
